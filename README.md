Includes Line/Waterpipe programs with changes to code, and the changes to the Grass program.

1) The code that draws the blades of grass is on line 11:
    line(x, height-10, x+random(-10, 10), height-10-random(h));
    
2) The "h" variable determines the initial height of the blades of grass and is the multiplier in the function. If it were changed to be greater than 10, the grass would grow taller faster, and if it were less than 10, the grass would grow much slower and be shorter.
